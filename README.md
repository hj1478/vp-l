# EarthMC Vote Party Tracker

A dependency-free Python script that polls the [EarthMC API](https://earthmc.net/docs/api)
and logs vote party progress (plus a snapshot of server stats) to a file.

The vote party data lives on the root server endpoint
(`GET https://api.earthmc.net/v4/`) as:

```json
"voteParty": { "target": 5000, "numRemaining": 1646 }
```

`collected = target - numRemaining`, so the tracker derives the count and percentage
each poll.

## Usage

```bash
python3 voteparty_tracker.py            # poll every 60s, log to voteparty.log
python3 voteparty_tracker.py -i 30      # poll every 30 seconds
python3 voteparty_tracker.py -f my.log  # custom log file
python3 voteparty_tracker.py --once     # single poll then exit
python3 voteparty_tracker.py --json     # also write machine-readable JSONL
```

Stop a running tracker with `Ctrl+C` (or `SIGTERM`); it logs a clean shutdown line.

## Options

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `-u`, `--url` | `https://api.earthmc.net/v4/` | Server endpoint to poll |
| `-f`, `--logfile` | `voteparty.log` | Human-readable log file |
| `-i`, `--interval` | `60` | Seconds between polls |
| `--once` | off | Poll once and exit |
| `--json [FILE]` | off (`voteparty.jsonl`) | Also append one JSON object per poll |

## What gets logged

Each poll appends a timestamped (UTC) line:

```
[2026-07-17T06:35:41Z] vote party 3398/5000 (68.0%) | 1602 remaining | players 406/800 | moon WAXING_CRESCENT
```

When the vote party fires (the remaining counter resets upward), it records a distinct event:

```
[...] *** VOTE PARTY FIRED! remaining reset 12 -> 4998 (+4986) ***
```

Network or parse errors are logged and the tracker keeps running.

The optional JSONL file captures the full snapshot per poll (target, remaining,
collected, percent, players, towns, nations, residents) for later analysis.
